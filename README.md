# ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
# I implemented a delete button on the posts
# I added a sign out button that redirects the user to the home page
# I impleneted an ascending order for the posts
# I created a SQL schema using supabase to store my comments in the website
# ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
# I added an ascending order but no option to change the posts by either ascending or descending order
# ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
# I was over complicating my work, I should've started from the ground up instead of focusing on the later tasks like the authenticator form took me a while and a couple of videos to get my head around and I think it made checking my code worse because supabase only allows two emails per hour unless you had an smtp server which was a hassle and costed money to set up. In hindsight adding a quick login feature would've been better and easier to check my code because with this there was times where I would be waiting for an email cause I had used the allocated emails for the hour.
